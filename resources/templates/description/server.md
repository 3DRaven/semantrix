## CodeReuseSearchService MCP Server

**CodeReuseSearchService** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides advanced semantic and fuzzy search capabilities for already implemented code, keywords, and types within your project.

### Key Features

- **Semantic Search:**  
  Search for code fragments using short descriptions or partial constructs, enabling context-aware discovery across code and comments.

- **Fuzzy Name Matching:**  
  Locate existing symbols using partial or full name patterns, supporting flexible and tolerant codebase navigation.

- **Code Reuse Focus:**  
  Designed to help developers and AI agents identify code that has already been implemented, reducing duplication and promoting efficient reuse.

- **LLM and IDE Integration:**  
  Exposes its tools via the standardized MCP protocol, allowing seamless integration with LLM-powered agents, IDEs, and automation systems.

- **Supports Local and Remote Sources:**  
  Can index and search both local repositories and remote codebases, and is compatible with vector databases for enhanced semantic search[11].

### Typical Use Case

A developer or AI agent submits semantic queries (descriptions or fragments of code logic) and/or name patterns (partial or full symbol names). The server analyzes the project, returning references to already implemented code that matches the queriesâ€”enabling fast code reuse and minimizing redundant work.

### Benefits

- Increases development efficiency by surfacing reusable code.
- Prevents redundant implementation of existing logic.
- Provides a unified, intelligent search interface for both humans and AI tools.
- Enhances codebase maintainability and knowledge sharing.
